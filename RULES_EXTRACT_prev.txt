introduction

Nemesis: Retaliation is a semi-cooperative board game designed for 1-5 players, which focuses on emergent narrative and the tension of 
the action-horror genre. Each player assumes the role of a marine squad member equipped with professional gear. They are sent to a Facility 
infested with deadly alien life forms and tasked with different missions – often conﬂicting with one another. But their primary objective is 
simple. Survive, above all.

simple gameplay overview

During  a  standard  game  of  Nemesis:  Retaliation,  you  will  take 
on  the  role  of  a  member  of  a  marines  squad,  being  dropped  in 
the  middle  of  a  Facility  infested  with  hordes  of  Intruders.  You  will 
Move around the Facility, slowly Exploring it by entering new Rooms 
and new Sections. You’ve got no intel on the layout of the Facility, 
so it’s up to you to discover how all Corridors connect.

Between an ofﬁcial Mission Task and a Private Objective, you will have 
to choose what’s more important to you. Most of the time, it will re-
quire careful cooperation with other marines, but sometimes you may 
be forced to leave someone behind or even go against them – after 
all, personal grudges and corruption happen even in the best of teams.

Throughout the game, you will be able to prepare for what’s to come 
in  a  variety  of  ways.  You  will  Search  for  essential  Items,  Secure 
Rooms and Reinforce Corridors. All of it, just to create a small illusion 
of safety. At times, you will use the functions of Rooms in the Facility, 
or even the Facility’s Robot.

equivalent.

Sooner or later, you will come upon the voracious Intruders, and with 
time,  more  and  more  will  come.  You  will  have  to  Shoot  and  Burst 
at them, throw Grenades, and use every other tool at your disposal 
to  resist  the  relentless  assault.  Be  ready  to  run  and  hide  just  as 
much. The Intruders are deadly and unpredictable, even one of them 
in the same Room as you may result in your untimely demise. When 
you do manage to escape, be careful of Contaminations! A scratch 
may  not  seem  signiﬁcant  now  but  may  result  in  something  much 
worse with time.

However, Intruders are not your only problem. There is also the topic 
of running out of Oxygen. 

You will have to ﬁnd additional Oxygen Supplies and, hopefuly, turn on 
Life Support Systems to even survive. Then, you’d better ﬁnd the con-
trols for the Anti-Aircraft Systems or the way to Activate the Hiberna-
torium.  Being  dropped  into  the  Facility  was  easy,  but  the  Lander  will 
have to actually land to take you off the Facility. Alternatively, just freeze 
yourself and wait for backup. Sooner, or later it will come right?

At some point, all Characters either Escape or end up dead. That’s 
where the story will conclude, by everyone checking if they managed 
to survive the Intruder Contamination and whether they fulﬁlled their 
hidden Objective. Hopefully, that will be you.

endgame conditions
winning and losing

A game of Nemesis may end up with multiple winners, but it is not 
a  cooperative  game.  Each  player,  in  the  end,  ﬁghts  for  their  own 
agenda.  Each  Character  not  only  strives  to  fulﬁll  one  of  the  two 
Objectives they start with, but they also must give their all to survive 
this mission, and ﬁnally ﬁnd a safe place.

All players that meet all following conditions are considered winners:

1.

Fulﬁlls  one  of  the  Objectives  –  At  the  start  of  the  game, 
each player is dealt 2 hidden Objectives – Private and Mission. 

a. Private  Objectives  show  a  unique  Objective 

for 

a Character.

b. Mission  Objectives  correspond  to  a  team’s  common 
Mission described on another card  – Mission task.

During the game each player will choose one of their Objec-
tives in hand to fulﬁll.

For details see: Objectives (page X).

2.

Escapes  the  Facility  –  Each  Character  must  ensure  their 
safety before the game ends. Not only does it mean not dying, 
but  also  using  a  Room  that  brings  them  to  a  safe  location 
such as:

a. Returning  to  the  main  ship  by  using  the  Lander  in 

the Landing Zone.

b. Locking  themselves  in  a  pod  by  Hibernating  in  the 

Hibernatorium.

c. Returning to the ship through the Escape Shuttle.

For details see: Escape Procedure (page X).

3.

Survives the Infection and Eclosion Procedures – These 
two end game procedures check if Characters die as a result 
of being infected.

Setup is divided into two parts – Game Setup and Player Setup.

Game Setup is straightforward and can be done in advance.

Player Setup involves drafting Characters and Support Equipment. Since it requires player choices, it should be done with all players gathered 
at the table.

player setup
objective setup 
and character draft
To setup the players, perform the following:

1.

2.

Find Help cards with numbers corresponding to the number 
of players taking part in the game (e.g. if there are 3 players 
in  the  game,  ﬁnd  cards  “1”,  “2”,  and  “3”).  Shufﬂe  them 
and deal one Help card to each player. Each player reveals 
their card. 

The number shown on the Help card is used in the following 
Character Draft, as well as for determining some Objectives 
during the game.

Take all Objective cards and divide them into 2 decks – Pri-
vate and Mission. Also, take the Mission Task deck. From 
each  deck  remove  all  cards  with  a  number  on  the  bottom 
higher than the number of players taking part in the game. 
Then, shufﬂe each deck separately and:

a. Deal face-down 1 random Private Objective card and 1 ran-
dom Mission Objective card to each player. Put the rest of 
those cards back in the box.

Keep your Objectives hidden, don’t reveal them to other 
players.
players.

OBJECTIVE CARDS
Objective  cards  are  secret  information  and  should 
never  be  revealed  to  other  players.  They  can  be 
discussed and lied about, however.

b. Draw 1 random Mission Task card and place it face-up on 
the Mission Task slot on the bottom Round track tile. Put 
the rest back in the box unseen.

3.

Shufﬂe  all  Character  draft  cards.  Deal  2  of  those  cards  in 
secret  to  Player  1.  That  player  chooses  one  of  those  cards 
and reveals it. The other card is shufﬂed back into the deck 
unseen. Perform this sequence likewise for each other player 
in ascending order.

character setup
Each player performs the following:

1.

2.

3.
4.

5.

6.

Take 1 Character board and place it in front of you. Then, 
place the Character tile matching your chosen Character in 
the Character board.
Take 1 Universal marker and place it in the left-most slot of 
the Health track on the bottom of the Character board.
Set your Oxygen counter to the max value – 7.
Take your chosen Character’s miniature, place it in a match-
ing colored ring, and place the miniature in the Landing Zone.
Take  the  Backpack  card  holder  with  your  player  number 
and place it above your Character board.
Take  all  Action  cards  for  your  Character,  shufﬂe  them 
and  place  them  to  the  left  of  your  Character  board,  face 
down – leave some space to the right of your Character board 

7.

Take your Character Item card – If it’s a Heavy Item, place 
it on one of the Hands slots of your Character board. If it’s 
Armor, place it in the Armor slot on the Heavily Injured part 
of the Health track. 
– Then, if the Item has Ammo slots, place 1 Ammo token 

from the supply full-side up on each such  slot.

Note: The Contractor starts with 2 Character Items.

8.

Finally, take all Character Draft cards and put them back 
into the box.

support Equipment draft
Perform the following. 

These  steps  only  apply  to  Characters  other  than  the  Contractor. 
Since the Contractor already starts with 2 Items, they do not take 
part in the Support Equipment draft.

3.

4.

Take the Support Equipment deck, shufﬂe it, draw 7 cards 
from it and reveal them to all players.
The  player  with  the  highest  player  number  chooses  1  of 
those  cards  and  places  it  in  the  appropriate  place  in  their 
player area – Heavy Items in Hand slots, Armor in the Heavily 
Injured Health track slot.
Each other player, in descending order, chooses 1 Equipment,

game round structure

The game is played in a series of Rounds.

Each Round is divided into 4 separate Phases.

players' turns
During their Turn a player must resolve the 3 following steps in order:

Perform 2 Actions

1.
2. Oxygen Loss
Fire Damage
3.

Players may also, once per game, choose an Objective during their 
Turn – this does not count as an Action.

For details see: Choosing Objective on the next page.

1. RESOLVING ACTIONS
In  a  given  Turn  a  player  must  perform  2  Actions  choosing  from 
the list below. Players may perform the same Action multiple times 
in any given Turn.

When  an  Action  is  performed,  the  player  discards  the  appropriate 
number of Action cards from hand (without resolving their effects) 
to their discard pile, face-up, and then resolves the corresponding 
effect of the chosen Action.

player phase

During  this  Phase  players  will  take  their  Turns  in  clockwise  order, 
beginning with the player with the Starting Player token. If a given 
player has Passed, they are skipped in Turn order.

reactions
Some Action cards can be used outside of normal Turn order to react 
to something happening in the game – they are Reactions.

At any point a player is able to play a Reaction card if the conditions 
described on the card are met. In such a case, the Reaction card is 
placed in front of that player, the card’s effect is resolved, and ﬁnally 
the card is placed on top of the discard pile.

Reactions are not Actions and do not count toward the Actions limit.

An Action card is divided into the following parts:

A. Not  In  Combat

  –  some  Action  cards  may  have 

this symbol here – they can not be used in Combat.

B. Name
C.

Effects – cards may have more than 1 effect to choose 
from.

D. Reaction – some cards may have a Reaction available.
E. Character  –  speciﬁes  which  Character  this  card 

belongs to.

playing action cards
When an Action card is played it is revealed and placed in front of 
the player, the card’s effect is resolved, and then the card is placed 
on top of the discard pile.

To play a card the player must be able to resolve its effect entirely.

passing
When a player Passes, they may discard any number of cards from 
their  hand  (for  example,  Contamination  cards)  and  then  their  Turn 
ends. 

From that point on, their Turns are skipped for the rest of the current 
Round.

They can still, however, use Reactions.

choosing an objective
During their Turns, players may also choose their Objective.

This can only be done once per game, when a given player still has 
2 Objective cards.

An Objective may be chosen before or after any of the 2 Actions in 
a Turn, but not in a middle of one, and it is NOT considered an Action 
for any purposes.

When an Objective is chosen, the player takes 1 of their Objective 
cards and removes it from the game. Then, the marker on the Ob-
jective choice track is moved by 1 and the player draws Action cards 
according to the marker.

Effectively,  each  Objective  choice  reduces  the  number  of  cards 
drawn by the next player that decides to choose an Objective.

The ﬁrst player draws 3 Action cards, the second 2 cards and so on.

The chosen Objective card must be fulﬁlled before the game ends 
for that player to be considered a winner.

orders and commands
Some effects allow Characters to perform an Action using another 
Character.  The  owner  of  that  Action  makes  all  choices  during 
that Action.

For  example  –  if  you  command  a  Character  to  Burst,  you  decide 
which  Corridor  that  Character  is  Bursting  at,  and  which  Weapon 
to use.

intruder phase

In the Intruder phase, Intruders will appear, move and attack.

The Intruder Phase is divided into 2 shorter steps that should be re-
solved in order. When the last step is resolved an Event Phase begins.

For details see: Fire markers (Page X) and Intruder’s Health (Page X).

Note: Since no die is rolled, this Hit can never kill an Intruder.

2. intruder attacks
Intruders in Rooms Attack.

Each Intruder in a Room with at least 1 Character Attacks the Char-
acter ﬁrst in Turn order. Each Attack is resolved separately starting 
with the Room on the top-left of the Facility. If there is more than 
one Intruder in a Room, start with the largest Intruders ﬁrst  – they 
all Attack the same Character.

For details see: Intruder Attacks (page X).

event phase 

  In  this  Phase,  an  Event  card  is  drawn  which  can  drastically  alter 
the situation in the game, and then the Intruders colony will develop 
modifying future possibilities of encounters.

3. event card resolution
Hordes move and unexpected things happen around the Facility.

Draw a card from the Event deck and resolve it in the following way. 
If the card describes effects that are impossible to resolve, ignore 
them.

AUTODESTRUCTION TOKEN
If  a  Round  token  enters  a  space  with  the  Autodestruction  token, 
the Facility explodes and the game ends. All Characters still inside 
the Facility (as well as Hibernating ones) die, every Room is consid-
ered destroyed and all Intruders are considered dead.

The Starting Player token passes clockwise to the next player.

For details see: Autodestruction Procedure (page X).

6. drawing Action cards
Characters prepare for the future.

Each  player  draws  Action  cards  from  their  deck  until  they  have  5 
cards in hand.

ACTION DECK RESHUFFLE
Whenever there are no more cards in your Action deck to be 
drawn  and  you  need  to  draw  another  one  (even  in  another 
phase) – ﬁrst reshufﬂe all cards from your discard pile, form 
a new Action deck and continue drawing.

7. time advancement
Time passes.

LANDER TOKEN 
If a Round token enters a space with a Lander token, the Lander tries 
to land in the Landing Zone Room. Check the Anti-Aircraft Systems by 
revealing the top Anti-Aircraft token: 

•

If  it  is  Inactive  (or  Anti-Aircraft  tokens  have  been  removed 
from  the  game),  the  Lander  lands  succesfully  –  place  it  in 
the Landing Zone Room.

• Otherwise,  the  Lander  is  destroyed  –  remove  it  from 

the game.

If the Lander landed, it is available to Characters from that point on 
and they may Escape the Facility using it.

For details see: Anti-Aircraft Systems (page X) and Escape Procedure 
(page X).

Progress the Round marker by 1. If the Round marker is already on 
the last space, proceed to the End of the Game instead.

GOLDEN RULES
Nightmare Rule – If you are at any point unsure about a certain 
ruling, order of effects, or cannot ﬁnd an answer to your questions, 
you  should  always  resolve  the  particular  situation  in  the  worst 
possible scenario for the players.

If  the  situation  is  still  unclear,  perform  it  in  the  worst  possible 
scenario for the ﬁrst player in Turn order.

Local Effects – Every effect in the game (unless speciﬁed oth-
erwise)  is  local  –  meaning  it  is  resolved  in  the  same  Room  as 
the Character performing the effect.

For  example:  “Place  a  Malfunction  marker”  means  you  place 
a Malfunction marker in the Room your Character is currently in.

Component  Limits  –  Most  components  are  limited  and  have 
special rules on what happens if they run out. For any other com-
ponents, consider them limited with no special rules – if they are 
to be used, and no more are available, nothing happens instead.

For  example:  Characters  cannot  gain  Ammo  tokens  if  all  are  al-
ready in players’ possession.

character 

During  game  setup  Character  tiles  are  placed  into  universal  Char-
acter boards. From that point on they are referred to as a singular 
Character board.

A  Character  board  is  a  component  showing  all  possible  Actions 
that can be performed by a Character. All effects, Wounds and other 
statuses impacting the Character are also placed there.

a. name and rank
Each  Character  has  their  Rank.  Several  effects  may  interact  with 
the Rank, for example, by allowing Characters of higher Rank to com-
mand Characters of lower Rank by the use of speciﬁc Action cards. 

For example: The Medical Support shown above has a Rank of 2.

b. health track
The Health track shows the current vitality of the Character  –  how many 
Injuries they have taken so far, their exhaustion, etc.

For details see: Health and Wounds (page X).

c. tactical belt
Each Character has their own Tactical Belt – it consists of 4 Tactical 
Gear slots, which can hold Tactical Gear tokens. 

TACTICAL GEAR SLOTS
You may ﬁnd Tactical Gear slots not just on your Tactical Belt but also 
on your Weapons and other Items.

USE ANY TACTICAL GEAR ACTION
When this Action is performed, choose any number of your Tactical 
Gear tokens and use them applying their effects. Then, discard all 
chosen tokens. 

You  may  also  move  any  number  of  your  tokens  between  your 
Tactical slots.

AMMO TOKENS 
Ammo  tokens  are  2-sided.  One  side  shows  a  Full  Ammo  token, 
and the other shows a Half Ammo token.

Using  an  Ammo  token  allows  you  to  Reload  a  Weapon  –  choose 
a  Weapon  and  move  an  Ammo  token  from  your  Tactical  Belt  onto 
the slot on the chosen Weapon. 

Important: You may never use an Ammo token that is already loaded 
into a Weapon – Ammo cannot be swapped between Weapons.

OXYGEN TOKENS 
Oxygen tokens are used to replenish a Character’s Oxygen Supplies.

GRENADE TOKENS 
Grenades  are  an  effective  way  of  ﬁghting  against  large  groups  of 
Intruders.

When a Grenade is used, the Character chooses an adjacent Corridor, 
rolls a Burst die, and adds 2 to the result. Then deal that many Hits 
in the chosen Corridor (in most cases it will mean killing that many 
Intruders).

This  roll  does  not  count  as  a  Character  Bursting  (Weapons  do  not 
apply to the result) and rolling 

 does not have any effect.

For details see: Combat (page X).

MEDPACK TOKENS 
Medpacks are used by Characters to patch up their light wounds.

When  a  Medpack  is  used,  the  Character  restores  2  Health 
Points 

.

For details see: Health and Wounds on page X.

d. hand slots
All Characters have 2 Hand slots on the top part of their Character 
board.

All  Heavy  Items  must  be  carried  in  Hands  –  1  Heavy  Item  can  be 
carried in 1 Hand slot at any moment.

health and wounds

A Character’s Health track is divided into 3 Sections:

serious wounds

• Healthy
•
Injured
• Heavily Injured

A Character is considered of a given state when their Health marker 
is on one of the slots of that Section. These Sections do not affect 
the game on their own, but Intruder Attacks frequently interact with 
the current state of the Attacked Character, sometimes even killing 
them outright.

Characters may lose or restore 
simply move your Health marker to the right or left accordingly.

 during the game. In such cases, 

When  a  Health  marker  moves  to  a  Section  with  an  Armor  Item, 
that Armor is discarded in addition to the Health lost – Armor does 
not prevent any damage unless speciﬁed by the Item itself.

For details see: Armor Items (page X).

When a Health marker is moved from the last slot, the Character dies.

death
When a Character dies, remove their miniature from the board. All of 
their Items and Objects they were carrying are lost as a result. They 
lost the game and no longer take part in it.

Characters can sometimes gain Serious Wounds (mostly as a result of 
Intruder Attacks). Serious Wounds are cards introducing major nega-

They can only be healed using certain Items and Rooms.

Whenever a Character gains a Serious Wound, a random card is drawn from the and placed in the leftmost Health Section.

If the Health marker is in a Section where a Serious Wound card is being placed, move the Health marker to the ﬁrst empty slot in the next 
Section.

Note: This may result in discarding an Armor Item.

discarding serious wounds
There are multiple ways to discard Serious Wounds – most commonly found on Items and Rooms.

Whenever a Character resolves an effect that discards a Serious Wound and they have more than one, they may choose which one to discard. 
In such a case slide the remaining Serious Wounds to the leftmost Health Sections. 

This does not move the Health marker in any way.

map

The  Map  in  Nemesis  shows  a  Facility  which  is  divided  into  3  Sec-
tions  –  A,  B  and  C.  The  Facility  consists  of  Rooms,  which  are 
always placed in one of the 3 Sections. The Rooms are connected 
by adjacent Corridors.

Characters can only be placed and perform Actions in Rooms, while 
Intruders may be placed both in Rooms and in Corridors.

FACILITY SIZE
The Section border pieces and the Round track border pieces create 
the  borders  of  the  Facility.  No  Room  and  no  Corridor  can  ever  be 
placed on those tiles or outside of those borders. This also applies 
to the right and the bottom side of the Facility.

sections

There are 2 important pieces of information about each Section:

•

•

Each one has its own Life Support System that may be either 
Active 
. Changing the status of 
those  systems  is  possible  in  Life  Support  Control  Rooms 
which are situated in every Section. 

 or Inactive 

For details see: Room List (page X).

Each Section has its own key Section Rooms described be-
low. Those Rooms are frequently required to fulﬁll Objectives. 
All other Rooms are random and may appear in any Section.

section a
Section  A  is  an  Entrance  Section  –  there  you  will  start  your

it. 

Drilling Room – A Room which allows drilling new Corridors. 

Life  Support  Control  A  –  Turns  on/off  Life  Support  Systems  in 
that Section.

Surgery  Room  –  Provides  the  easiest  way  to  deal  with  Serious 
Wounds and even a Larva Infection if it were to occur.

section b
Section B is the middle Section with the Hibernatorium – one way 
to safely ﬁnish the mission in the Facility. Important Rooms include:

Hibernatorium – Provides a way to ensure safety for multiple Char-
acters. It is both turned off 
 and Undiscovered at the start 
– the Hibernatorium can be turned on in Life Support Control C.

Cooling System – Allows you to turn on the Autodestruction system 
in case of emergencies.

For details see: Autodestruction Procedure (page X).

Life Support Control B – You can check and change the status of 
Anti-Aircraft systems here and turn on/off Life Support Systems in 
that Section. 

For details see: Anti-Aircraft system (page X).

Server Room – Its most important function is allowing  you to gather 
Data required for some Objectives.

section c
Section C is the most dangerous Section. Important Rooms include:

Life Support Control C – Turns on the Hibernatorium and turns on/
off Life Support Systems in that Section. 

The Nest – Dangerous Room with Intruder eggs. 

For details see: Nest on the next page.

The  Reactor  –  An  extremely  treacherous  Room.  This  completely 
shuts off the Power in the Facility, turning off (and preventing from 
turning on again) all Support Control Systems, the Autodestruction 
system and the Anti-Aircraft system.

nest
The Nest is a special Room with a big signiﬁcance for the game.

The Nest has its own space on Section border piece C which contains 
5 Egg tokens at the start of the game. This space is considered to be 
an extension of the Nest Room tile, meaning Characters in the Nest 
Room  can  interact  with  Egg  tokens  and  are  considered  to  be  in 
a Room with Egg tokens.

Eggs are Heavy Items and can be picked up using the Nest Room 
Action.

For details see: Heavy Items (page X) and Room List (page X).

You can destroy the Nest by removing all Eggs from the Section C 
border  piece  (by  using  the  Nest’s  Room  Action).  When  there  are 
no more Eggs there, place a Universal marker in the Nest space on 
the Section C border piece – this signiﬁes the Nest being destroyed. 
It stays destroyed even if other effects would add new Eggs there.

rooms

Rooms are the main structure of the game – Characters Move be-
tween neighboring Rooms. Each Room has plenty of Icons related 
to available Actions. 

Rooms are divided into 2 types – Section Rooms (A, B and C) which 
belong  to  an  associated  Section  and  always  appear  in  the  game, 
and random Rooms, which are not certain to appear in the game.

Room tiles contain the following information:

A. Name
B.

Effect – A short description of the Room’s effect when Using 
a Room – many different Actions can do so.

For details see: Room List found on the Room Help Sheet.

C.

Item  Icons  –  Shows  which  Items  are  available  in  a  given 
Room. Mostly referenced by the Search Action card.

D. Computer Icon – Shows whether the Room contains a con-
nection to the server. The Icon does nothing on its own but is 
frequently referenced by other Actions.

E. Room  Type  and  Room  ID  –  Shows  whether  the  Room  is 
a  Section  Room  or  a  random  Room  Identyfying  Number  is 
used for various tie-breakers.

F. Other  Icons  –  Rooms  may  also  feature  some  other  Icons, 

showing special rules:

 – Such Rooms are never Secured and can never have 

Secure tokens placed on them.
For details see: Secure tokens (page X).

  –  These  Rooms  can  never  be  broken.  A  Malfunction 

marker is never placed on them.
For details see: Malfunction markers (page X).

corridors

To Move from Room to Room Characters will use through adjacent 
Corridors. As a result of Movement and other Actions, Noise markers 
are placed in Corridors alerting you to incoming danger. 

In contrast to Rooms, Corridors may sometimes be placed on a bor-
der of 2 Sections. In such a case, that Corridor is considered to be 
in both Sections.

Noise may ﬁnally turn into Intruders, which will be placed in Corri-
dors – such Intruders then will move between Corridors and Rooms.

A Corridor can hold:

•

A Queen and up to 2 Adults/Drones

REINFORCED CORRIDOR
Empty Corridors can be Reinforced by Characters during the game. 

This is most commonly found on Action cards.

When a Corridor is Reinforced, discard a Noise marker from it and ﬂip 
it to the other side. That side has a “0” value shown. Noise marker 
won’t be placed on such a Corridor as a result of a Noise roll (since 
there is no 0 on the die).

However, Intruders can still move into such a Corridor.

Note: Corridors leading to the Hibernatorium can never be Reinforced.

doors

Some  Corridors  may  come  with 
Door slots – this means that there 
are Open Doors there. With appro-
priate effects Doors can be Closed 
- signiﬁed by placing Door tokens.

A Room and a Corridor joined by 
a  Door  are  considered  adjacent 
(and  2  Rooms  with  a  Door  in 
between  are  still  considered 
neighboring),  but  the  Door  im-
poses some limitations – such as 
preventing Movement or Bursting.

Important: All Corridors, at the moment of placement, are oriented 
with a Door slot in direction of the Room just placed.

blocking path
Closed  Doors  block  the  access  to  anything  (with  the  exception  of 
a Noise marker) on the other side. Characters cannot perform any 
Actions that inﬂuence objects behind Closed Doors. 

Note:  Effects  that  speciﬁcally  call  out  “any  object  in  the  Facility”,  like 
Moving to any Room in the Facility, still work and allow you to Move even 
to a Room closed by Doors from all sides.

Characters  cannot  Move  through  a  Corridor  with  Closed  Doors  – 
they must Open or Destroy the given Door ﬁrst (mostly as a result of 
using Action or Item cards).

Intruders, when attempting to move through Closed Doors, Destroy 
them instead.

INTERACTING WITH DOORS
Doors may become: 

• Closed – Doors can only be Closed in places with Door slots. 

When Closing a Door, simply place a Door token there.

• Opened – Remove the Door token from the board.
• Destroyed – If there is a closed Door, it may be Destroyed 
– lay the Door token down. Such a Door is now considered to 
be the same as Open, but cannot be Closed again.

DOORS AND SPREADING FIRE 
Event  cards  and  other  effects  may  Spread  Fire    between  Rooms. 
If  Fire  would  spread  between  2  Rooms  blocked  by  Closed  Doors, 
ignore that spread instead – Doors block spreading Fire.

24

map markers 
and tokens

In Nemesis various markers and tokens can be placed in the Facility 
portraying various states of Rooms and Corridors.

Noise markers can be placed in Corridors and are explained more 
in the Character Movement part of the Rulebook.

Malfunction  markers,  Fire  markers  and  Secure  tokens  are 
placed in Rooms and only affect them.

fire markers
Fires  are  a  common  occurence  in  destroyed  Facilities.  They  are 
equally dangerous for humans and Intruders alike. Yet, the biggest 
danger is the possibility of Fires spreading and enveloping the whole 
base.

Fire markers 
 are placed in Rooms. Each Room may contain only 
1 Fire marker. If a Fire marker is to be placed in a Room with one 
already, simply ignore it.

If at any point you must place a Fire marker and there are no more 
Fire markers available, the Facility is destroyed and the game ends. 

For details see: End of the Game (page X).

Fire markers affect the game in three ways:

1. When  a  Character  ends  their  Turn  in  a  Room  with  a  Fire 

marker, they lose 1

.

For details see: Player Turn (page X).

2. During the Event Phase each Intruder in a Room with a Fire 

marker is dealt 1 Hit.

For details see: Intruders Burning (page X).

3.

Fire markers may spread as a result of some Events. Spread-
ing Fire means placing Fire markers in neighboring Rooms 
according to the instructions on a given card. 

Doors prevent Fire from spreading.

malfunction markers
Malfunction  markers 
  represent  something  being  broken 
and impossible to use. They can be placed on many different compo-
nents such as Rooms, Heavy Items and Robot cards.

Regardless  what  they  are  placed  on,  that  component  cannot  be 
used. You can ﬁnd speciﬁc information on how Malfunction markers 
interact with components below.

ON ROOMS
Each Room may only contain 1 Malfunction marker. If a Malfunction 
marker is to be placed in a Room with one already, simply ignore it. 

If a Room has a Malfunction marker its Room Action is unavailable, 
and cannot be performed in any way.

ON HEAVY ITEMS
When a Malfunction marker is placed on a Heavy Item, it cannot be 
used in any way (its Action cannot be used, and that Item cannot be 
used to Shoot nor Burst) and is treated as if that Item had no text 
and no icons.

When a Malfunction marker is to be placed on an Item with one already 
there, the Item is destroyed and must be discarded instead. The Mal-
function markers go back to the pool.

ON A ROBOT
When placed on a Robot card, the Robot cannot be used in any way 
(neither Rooms interacting with the Robot, nor Robot Actions). Treat 
the Robot card as having no text and no icons.

If a Malfunction marker is to be placed on a Robot when there is one 
there already, simply ignore it.

DISCARDING MALFUNCTION MARKERS
Many  effects  allow  you  to  discard  Malfunction  markers  –  you 
can do so from the Room your Character is in, or any Item/Robot in 
that Room (unless the effect states otherwise).

MALFUNCTION MARKERS LIMIT
MALFUNCTION MARKERS LIMIT
If  at  any  point  you  have  to  place  a  Malfunction  marker 
If  at  any  point  you  have  to  place  a  Malfunction  marker 
and there are no more markers available, place a Fire marker 
and there are no more markers available, place a Fire marker 
in the Room instead, if possible.

place a Fire marker in your Room.

secure tokens
Securing Rooms is one of the Actions that allow Characters to pre-
pare for Intruder Attacks. Secure tokens 
 protect Characters from 
Attacks directed by Intruders entering Room. 

Many Actions may place Secure tokens in Rooms. There is a limit of 
3 Secure tokens in any given a Room.

Important: Characters can never Secure a Room with an Intruder 
inside.

Note:  Some  Rooms  may  be  impossible  to  Secure  (such  as  a  Nest 
Room)  and  some  Rooms  are  always  Secured  (such  as  a  Shelter 
Room).

RESOLVING SECURE TOKENS:
Whenever  an  Intruder  enters  a  Room  with  at  least  1  Character 
and a Secure token, 1 Secure token is discarded instead of resolving 
the Intruder Attack.

Discarding Secure tokens is a result of Intruder movement and can 
never be prevented.

For details, see the next page.

There are 2 exceptions to this step:

Exploration  cards  facilitate  that  –  they  show  new  Corridors 
and Rooms that will appear on the board. Even though they are used 
as  a  result  of  Movement,  the  cards  do  not  show  the  the  Corridor 
the Character Moved through.

The  Exploration  Sequence  is  resolved  by  drawing  an  Exploration 
card  and  resolving  it  in  the  empty  space  of  the  Unexplored  Corri-
dor, in the following order. The Exploration card should be oriented 
the same way as the board – do not rotate it.

1.

Set  up  the  Room  –  Check  the  type  of  Room  described 
on  the  top  of  the  card,  draw  a  random  Room  of  that  type 
and place it face up in an empty space opposite the Corridor 
you are Moving through.
– If there are no more Rooms of the required type, place 

the “?” Room instead.

2.

Set up the Corridors – Around the new Room, place a ran-
dom Corridor face up in each space shown on the card, if its 
not already there. 

If a Corridor has a Door slot – place it so the Door slot con-
nects with the newly Explored Room. 

a. No Corridors lead out of the Facility – if a Corridor leads 
to a space that could not hold a Room, it is not set up.
b. No Corridors lead to already placed Rooms – if a Corridor 
leads to a Room that is already placed on the map, it is 
not set up.

Note:  Since  there  was  never  a  Corridor  leading  out  of 
an  established  Room,  one  should  not  appear  around  it 
out of nowhere.

3.

Set up markers and tokens – Place all markers and tokens 
on Corridors and Rooms shown on the card. 

a. You  cannot  place  a  Noise  marker  in  a  Corridor  that  al-

ready has one – nothing happens in that case.

4. Movement  and  Securing  Reminder  –  If  a  Character  is 
Moving Cautiously, the Secure token should be placed at this 
point.
Exploration  Effect  –  Some  cards  may  have  an  additional 
effect that should be resolved at this point.
Insider icon – this icon is not used in the base game, ignore it.
Discard the card.

character movement
movement sequence

Characters  may  Move  as  a  result  of  many  different  effects,  most 
commonly  by  performing  the  “Make  a  Move”  Action.  Character 
Movement is always done from a Room to another Room. Characters 
are never placed in Corridors.

The Movement sequence goes as follows:

1.

Choose Direction – Choose an adjacent Corridor your Char-
acter is going to Move through.

2. Resolve Opportunity Attacks – If there are any Intruders in 
the same Room as the Character OR in the Corridor the Char-
acter  wants  to  Move  through  –  resolve  an  Intruder  Attack 
for each Intruder starting with the largest Intruders (but no 
more than 3 Attacks).

For details see: Intruder Attacks (page X).

3.

See the impact of your Movement 

If you are Moving to an already Discovered Room – Move 
the  Character  (and  place  a 
  if  you  are  Moving  Cau-
tiously) and make a Noise roll.

b.

If  you  are  Moving  through  an  Unexplored  Corridor 
to  an  Undiscovered  Room  –  Resolve  the  Exploration 
Sequence.

For details, see below.

Sometimes an effect (such as a Technical Corridor Entrance Room) 
may allow a Character to Move to a speciﬁc Room regardless of dis-
tance. In such a case resolve the sequence above with the exception 
of the Choose Direction step.

For details see: Room List (page X).

exploration sequence

At  the  start  of  the  game,  the  Facility  is  mostly  unexplored.  New 
Rooms and Corridors appear as a result of Characters Moving to un-
charted territory and exploring on their own.

Whenever a Character Moves through an Unexplored Corridor they

ment section above).

noise roll

A Noise roll is performed as a result of many different Actions and ef-
fects (most commonly as a result of Movement) and is also the main 
way of Noise markers 

 appearing on the board.

ALWAYS ROLL FOR NOISE
A Noise roll is resolved even when Moving to a Room contain-
ing another Character and/or Intruder.

When  making  a  Noise  roll,  take  the  Noise  die,  roll  it  and  resolve 
effects depending on the result of the roll:

•

1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4  Number result  – Find all Corridors ad-
jacent to the Room your Character is in that share the rolled 
value. For each such Corridor, resolve in the following order:
– If the Corridor contains at least 1 Intruder – One Intruder 
managed  to  breach  your  defenses.  The  largest  Intruder 
from  that  Corridor  moves  to  the  Room  containing 
the Character.

– If the Corridor already contains a Noise marker – Intrud-
  (Noise 

ers  appeared  in  the  Corridor.  Resolve  the 
marker) there – see below.

– If  the  Corridor  has  NO  Noise  markers  –  You’ve  heard 
something. Place a Noise marker there (even on the other 
side of a Door).

Reminder:  When  an  Intruder  is  placed  in  your  Room,  it 
immediately tries to Attack you – for details see: Intruder 
Attack (page X).

– If there is no Corridor of the corresponding value – noth-

ing happens.

•

Hazard result – An Intruder appears in the Room out 
of  nowhere.  Draw  an  Intruder  token  from  the  Intruder  bag 
and resolve it according to the table below. 

You are only interested in the icon on the drawn token – it 
shows  you  what  kind  of  Intruder  is  placed  in  your  Room. 
Disregard completely the value on the token. 

Discard the token afterwards.

Reminder: When an Intruder is placed in your Room, it immediately 
tries to Attack you – for details see: Intruder Attack (page X).

RESOLVING NOISE MARKERS 
Noise  markers  are  resolved  most  frequently  as  a  result  of  rolling 
the Noise die, but may also occur from other effects, such as from 
Event  cards.  Resolving  a  Noise  marker  is  understood  as  Intruders 
appearing before you in Corridors.

To resolve a Noise marker remove it, draw a random Intruder token 
from  the  Intruder  bag  and  resolve  it  according  to  the  table  below. 
The number on the token’s back shows you how many Intruders are 
placed in the Corridor. 

Then, discard the token (unless stated otherwise).

tokens from that Item.

items

Items  come  in  many  different  shapes  and  sizes.  Each  Character 
starts  the  game  with  their  own  Character  Item.  During  setup  they 
also get a Support Equipment, and throughout the game they may 
ﬁnd other regular Items.

All Item cards are either:

• Heavy – with a horizontal layout, that can only be placed in 

Hand slots.

• Armor – with a vertical layout marked on the top of the card. 
Armor is always placed in a Heavily Injured Health track slot.
• Regular – with a vertical layout. The broadest type of Items, 

which are placed in the Backpack.

All Items are either Active or Passive.

Passive Items provide effects that can always be applied at an own-
er’s discretion. Those Items can never be used by performing a “Use 
an Item” Action.

Active Items, on the other hand, must be used for their effects to be 
applied. Most of these Items are also discarded upon use.

Traits – on various Items you may ﬁnd some traits, which describe 
how a given Item can be used . Besides the Armor and the Heavy 
Traits, there are:

•

Ranged Weapon, Melee Weapon – these Traits are common 
and simply describe the Item. They have no effect on their 
own, but many Actions may reference them. Weapons Found 
During the Game:

During the game Weapons are always found with all Tactical 
Gear slots ﬁlled.

• One Use Only – These Items are discarded when Used.
•

Requires  no  Ammo  –  Weapons  with  this  Trait  are  special 
and require no Ammo tokens to Shoot and Burst. 

Note:  For  the  sake  of  Actions  that  require  Weapons  with 
Ammo tokens, those Items are considered as always having 
an Ammo token on them.  

backpack
All  regular  Items  are  always  placed  in  a  Backpack  card  holder 
and can be used by performing the “Use Item” Action. There is no 
limit to the number of regular Items that can be held in the Backpack.

regular items
The most common type of Items are regular Items. When these Items 
are used, simply resolve their effect. All regular Items are One Use 
Only – meaning they are discarded upon use to an Item discard pile.

When a regular Item card is gained, simply place it in the Backpack 
card holder.

heavy items
All Items with a horizontal layout are Heavy Items. Heavy Items are 
too big to ﬁt in a Backpack and must be held in one of the Hand slots.

If such an Item is gained when all Hand slots are already taken, you 
may ﬁrst discard one of the held Items to make space for the new 
Item.

Weapons (both Ranged and Melee) are an important subtype of Heavy 
Items.  Ranged  Weapons  are  necessary  to  Shoot  and  Burst.  Melee 
Attacks  can  be  done  with  either  type  of  weapon,  although  Melee 
Weapons can do so much better.

Intruder Eggs are also considered Heavy Items.

For details see: Nest (page X).

armor
Armor  Items  are  all  Items  with  the  special  triple  arrow  symbol  on 
the top. When gained, an Armor Item is always placed on the Heavily 
Injured section of the Health track. 

Only one Armor Item can be worn at any moment. When a Character 
gains an Armor Item while already using one, they may ﬁrst discard 
the Armor Item from their Health track to gain the new Armor. Armor 
does not ﬁt into a Backpack card holder.

When  a  Health  marker  is  to  be  moved  to  a  Health  track  section 
with an Armor Item, that Armor Item breaks and must be discarded, 
and then the rest of damage is applied.

trade and interplay

In Nemesis most effects (from Actions and Items) are used on your 
own  Character.  The  same  way,  most  of  the  time  interaction  with 
Items belonging to other Characters does not happen.

It is possible to use an Item on another Character in the same Room, 
if the Character in the same Room allows you to do so, and the Item 
has one of the following effects:

Restoring 

•
• Discarding Serious Wounds
• Discarding 
Discarding 
Gaining 
• Gaining 

 (from Items belonging to another Character)

For any other effect, you must Trade the Item to another Character, 
so that they can use it themselves.

Trading
When a Character uses the Trade Action, all Characters in the same 
Room  may,  with  mutual  consent,  reveal  and  exchange  Items  and/
or Tactical Gear tokens with each other. A Character may choose to 
give an Item and/or Tactical Gear token without asking for anything 
in return.

Intruders are an alien species that humanity knows very little about. 
They  are  aggressive  and  intelligent  creatures.  Intruders  come  in 
many different types described below. All rules regarding Intruders 
will be explained from the perspective of Adults since they are most 
commonly met in Nemesis, but they apply to Intruders of all types, 
unless strictly described otherwise.

intruder movement

Intruders  move  between  Corridors  and  Rooms  in  many  different 
situations.  Below  you  may  ﬁnd  general  rules  that  apply  to  most 
movements,  followed  by  a  quick  summary  of  all  possibilities 
that may occur, and then an in-depth description of each situation 
on the following pages.

intruder types

Intruders in Nemesis come in 4 different types seen above. Starting 
from the largest:

The Queen – there is only one, an extremely durable and aggressive 
enemy.

Drones are rare but more dangerous than typical Adults.

Adults are the most standard type seen very frequently. They com-
monly hunt with other Intruders as a group.

Larvae  can  sometimes  be  found  in  the  Facility  –  they  are  not  as 
deadly as the other Intruders, but come with a nasty surprise.

INTRUDERS LIMIT

Intruders  can  be  placed  in  both  Rooms  and  Corridors.  While

Rooms can hold any number of Intruders, the maximum num-
ber of Intruders that can be placed in any Corridor is 6 (with 
the Queen counting as 4 Intruders).

For details see: Corridors (page X).

worse.

general rules:

•

Intruders  move  to  the  closest  Character  using  the 
shortest route – Intruders always move as the group in the 
direction  of  closest  Character  (unless  speciﬁed  otherwise) 
using the shortest possible route.
– Doors  are  completely  disregarded  when  determining 

which route is the shortest.

– In case of 2 or more Characters being the same distance 
away,  Intruders  move  to  the  Character  closest  in  Turn 
order.

•

Intruders  move  between  Rooms  and  Corridors  – If 
the moving Intruders are in a Corridor, they move to a Room. If 
they are in a Room, they move to a Corridor.

•

• Only 1 Intruder enters a Room with a Character – When-
ever  Intruders  move  to  a  Room  with  a  Character,  only 
the largest Intruder moves to that Room instead.
Intruders  Attack  when  moving  to  a  Room  with  a  Char-
acter – Whenever an Intruder enters a Room with a Charac-
ter – they always try to Attack (some effects may allow you 
to prevent that Attack, that as Secure tokens).
Intruders  stay  in  Combat  –  Intruders  never  move  when 
they are in the same Room as a Character. They do not move 
away from Combat.

•

intruder bag

During many different Phases you will draw tokens from the Intruder 
bag – any time that happens resolve the token according to the In-
truder Help sheet and remove the token from the bag. Tokens are 
always removed upon being resolved, with the only exception being 
the Blank token, which is speciﬁcally called out by the Intruder Help 
sheet.

Speciﬁc instructions on how to resolve the Intruder bag can be found 
on page X (Bag development).

summary 
of possible movements
Event cards – Intruders move according to the icons on the Event 
card.

Noise  roll  –  May  sometimes  result  in  Intruders  entering  a  Room 
from an adjacent Corridor.

Repelling – Different effects may result in Intruders moving away 
from Characters.

Queen  Activation  –  One  of  the  possible  effects  of  the  Queen’s 
Activation may result in her movement.

Whenever a Character makes a Noise roll, if Intruders are in adjacent 
Corridors indicated by the result of the roll, one of the Intruders (priori-
tizing the largest forms) from each such Corridor enters the Character’s 
Room and Attacks them.

repelling
Many different effects may cause Intruders to be repelled. If a Char-
acter repels an Intruder in an adjacent Corridor – that Intruder moves 
away from that Character (or any other source of the repel effect).

If an Intruder is being repeled, and its farther away from the source of 
that effect, it moves to the Corridor/Room with the lowest ID number. 

Repelling may result in:

•

•

•

An Intruder moving out of the Unexplored Corridor outside of 
the visible map. In that case, the Intruder stays where they 
are. It is impossible to Repel them further.

them instead.
An Intruder entering a Room with Characters – in that case, 
they Attack the ﬁrst Character in Turn order in that Room.

queen's activation
For details see: Queen’s Activation (page X).

Drawing a Queen token may result in the Queen’s Activation – which 
will result in either the Queen Attacking or moving if there is nothing 
to Attack. The Queen moves exactly the same as other Intruders.

  in  every  Room  move  –  Move  all  Intruders  currently  in 

All 
Rooms, regardless of Section.

When resolving Intruder movement apply the General Rules (always 
move towards the closest Character, using the shortest route) – start 
from the top-left corner of the Facility and move each group of In-
truders individually.

Intruders will attack Characters on many different occasions. Most 
commonly  this  happens  when  an  Intruder  enters  a  Room  with 
a Character.

standard attacks
Whenever an Intruder Attacks a Character, draw a random Intruder 
Attack  card  (with  the  exception  of  Larvae  Attacks,  which  are  de-
scribed below). 

The  card  is  resolved  by  ﬁnding  an  icon  matching  the  Attacking  In-
truder type (A) and resolving the associated effect (B). Then, the card 
is discarded.

The  Intruder  Attack  deck  is  only  reshufﬂed  when  instructed  by 
the game.

LARVA ATTACKS
When a Larva is Attacking a Character instead perform the following:

1.

2.

Place the Attacking Larva on the Character board. If the At-
tacked  Character  already  has  a  Larva  on  their  Character 
board – simply discard the Attacking Larva instead.
The  Attacked  Character  gains  1  Contamination  card 
and places it on their discard pile.

For details see: Contamination cards (page X).

GOLDEN RULES OF INTRUDER ATTACKS
Whenever an Intruder enters a Room with at least 1 Character, 
the Intruder resolves an Intruder Attack (unless prevented by 
a Secure token or another in-game effect). 
If the Intruder entered as a result of a player Action, they Attack 
that Character if possible. 
Otherwise, they Attack the Character ﬁrst in Turn order.

PREVENTING ATTACKS
Various effects on Action cards and Items may allow a Character to 
Prevent an Intruder Attack.

If that happens, ignore the entire Intruder Attack – do not apply any 
additional effects and do NOT draw an Intruder Attack card.

34

intruder health and combat

Characters  can  ﬁght  Intruders  in  many  different  ways.  They  can 
use  precise,  single  shots  at  Intruders  in  the  same  Room  or  Burst 
at the hordes charging through Corridors. In the direst of situations 
Melee Attacks are also an option.

No matter which type of Combat occurs, the effect of such will always 
result in assigning Hits to Intruders. When Intruders are in Corridors 
each  Hit  will  kill  a  single  Intruder  (by  simply  removing  them  from 
the map). When they are in a Room each Hit should be understood as 
a Injury dealt (by placing Universal markers by the Intruder’s model). 

WEAPONS
Nearly  all  Combat  in  Nemesis  is  done  using  Weapons.  When 
a Weapon is chosen to be used in an Action, all effects and modiﬁers 
from the chosen Weapon must be applied, unless stated otherwise. 
Effects of rolling a speciﬁc result are done in addition to the standard 
result provided below.

shooting

bursting

Shooting at very agile Intruders in 
cramped Rooms is a difﬁcult task. 
Shooting  in  Nemesis  will  produce 
singular  Hits.  Each  Hit  increases 
the likelihood of an Intruder dying, 
but that is never certain.

Characters  may  only  Shoot  at 
the  same  Room 
Intruders 
and a Shot may only be done if the Character, in one of their Hand 
slots,  has  a  Weapon  with  no  Malfunction  marker  and  at  least  1 
Ammo token on it.

in 

For details see: Heavy Items (page X).

Shooting  does  not,  however,  use  Ammo  (except  for  one  speciﬁc 
result  of  the  roll,  see  further  below)  –  Characters  use  advanced 
equipment where a single bullet loss is not signiﬁcant, unless it was 
the last one.

Shooting is resolved in the following way:

1.

Choose  a  Weapon  and  a  target  –   Choose  a  Weapon  in 
a  Hand  slot.  That  Weapon  must  have  at  least  1  Ammo  to-
ken  on  it.  Then,  choose  an  Intruder  in  the  same  Room  as 
the Character.

2. Deal 1 Hit – place 1 Universal marker next to the Intruder’s 

base.

3. Make a Shoot roll – Roll a Shoot die and resolve the result.

truder pool.

4 :  Normal  hit.  If  the  number  rolled  is 
lower than the number of Hits on the Intruder, the Intruder

 – A hit with your last bullet. Spend 

.

Note: Larvae and the Queen are dealt Hits the same way, but their 
Health is resolved differently. For more see: Queen Health (page X) 
and Larvae Health (page X).

SPEND 
An Ammo token can be used twice before it’s depleted. If you 
have a full Ammo token and the game instructs you to spend 
it – ﬂip it.
If you have a half-empty Ammo token and the game instructs 
you to spend it – discard it.

When  Intruders  are  cramped  in 
a  narrow  Corridor  it’s  best  to  use 
Burst  ﬁre.  It  uses  a  signiﬁcant 
amount  of  Ammo,  but  it’s  well 
worth it. 

A  Burst  may  only  be  ﬁred 
if 
the Character, in one of their Hand 
slots,  has  a  Weapon  with  no  Mal-

function marker and at least 1 Ammo token on it. 

For details see: Heavy Items (page X).

Bursts  are  always  ﬁred  at  an  adjacent  Corridor  of  a  Characters 
choice and will result in Hits that are applied to Intruders in that Cor-
ridor.  Hits  applied  will  kill  Intruders  –  different  types  of  Intruders 
require different numbers of Hits to be killed.

For details see: Queen’s Health (page X).

Bursting is resolved in the following way:

1.

2.

Choose  a  Weapon  and  a  Corridor  –   Choose  a  Weapon  in 
a Hand slot. That Weapon must have at least 1 Ammo token 
on it. Then, choose an adjacent Corridor to Burst at.
  and  roll 
  and  make  a  Burst  roll  –  Spend 
Spend 
a Burst die. The number on the die shows how many Hits will 
be applied to Intruders in the chosen Corridor.

3. Apply  Hits  –  Apply  Hits  to  Intruders  in  the  Corridor  in  any 

way you decide.

4. Resolve Hits – Each Adult with 1 Hit and a Drone with 2 Hits 

dies – place it back in the Intruder pool.
– You  may  not  apply  1  single  Hit  to  Drones.  When  Burst-
ing, Hits are always applied only if they can take down 
the given Intruder.

5.

 – If you rolled this result, check for any additional effects 
that may apply (for example, from your Weapon) it does not 
provide any additional effects by itself.

1 Hit is always enough to kill a Larva (even when Shooting) – how-
ever you still must roll the appropriate die when Shooting/Bursting 
a Larva in case of special effects or the 

 result.

drone health
Killing  Drones  is  only  harder  when  they  are  in  Corridors.  Shooting 
them  in  Rooms  is  always  resolved  the  same  as  Shooting  Adult 
Intruders.

INTRUDER HIT MARKERS
Intruders  in  Corridors  never  have  Hit  markers  placed  beside 
them.  An  injured  Intruder  moving  to  a  Corridor  discards  all 
markers they may have had.

melee attack

In  dire  situations,  a  Character  may  choose  to  Melee  Attack  an  In-
truder in the same Room. This should be done only as a last resort, 
because if the Intruder lives through the Attack it will try to retaliate.

To perform a Melee Attack resolve the following:

1.

Gain 1 Contamination card – Getting that close to Intruders 
is always a bad idea.

2. Choose  a  target  –  This  must  be  an  Intruder  in  the  same 

Room as the Character.

queen health
The  Queen’s  Health  works  a  little  differently  than  other  Intruders, 
and is facilitated by the Queen’s Health cards. The Queen is much 
harder to kill than any other Intruder.

queen activation
At  many  points  of  the  game  the  Queen  may  Activate  –  mostly  as 
a result of drawing a Queen token from the Intruder bag.
When the Queen Activates:

•

If she is in a Room with at least 1 Character – The Character 
ﬁrst  in  Turn  order  in  that  Room  is  Attacked  by  the  Queen 
using the standard Intruder Attacks rules.

• Otherwise  –  The Queen moves in the direction of the closest 
Character. The movement is from a Room to a Corridor or from 
a Corridor to a Room.

Throughout the game Characters may deal Hits to the Queen, both 
by Shooting and Bursting and in effect draw cards from the Queen 
Health deck. Those cards will have many different effects, but most 
importantly each time a random number of them will be discarded. 
The Queen will be killed only when all cards are discarded.

DEALING HITS AND DISCARDING CARDS
Bursts and Shots at the Queen deal Hits to her as normal, according 
to the instructions in the Combat section of the Rulebook. For each 
Hit dealt to the Queen progress the Universal marker on the Queen’s 
Hits slots by 1.

Whenever the Queen Health marker reaches the ﬁnal 

 space (or 

 is dealt in any other way): 
• Draw the top card of the Queen Health deck.
•
• Discard the drawn card and reset the Queen Health track.

Resolve it (discarded cards are NOT revealed).

QUEEN DEATH
When the last Queen’s Health card is discarded the Queen is consid-
ered dead. In that case remove her model from the game.
From that point on:

•
•

Ignore effects that would place the Queen in the Facility.
Flip the Intruder Help sheet – Queen tokens will now behave 
differently.

contamination 
cards

Contamination  cards  are  one  of  the  consequences  of  interacting 
with Intruders. Some effects, such as Intruder Attacks, may result 
in Characters receiving Contamination cards. 

hidden text
Each Contamination card contains hidden text that remains a secret 
until a game effect allows the player to Scan a Contamination card. 

Can't be discarded for Actions. 
You may discard this card when you Pass.

When a Contamination card is gained, it is always placed in a Char-
acter’s discard pile.

Contamination cards are undesirable by players and affect them in 
two ways:

1.

2.

They  ﬁll  up  the  Action  deck  –  Although  Contamination 
cards  share  the  back  layout  with  Action  cards  (since  they 
are shufﬂed with the Action cards), they are NOT considered 
Action  cards.  This  means  they  can  NOT  be  used  as  Action 
cards to pay for Actions. They are, simply speaking, useless.
They increase the risk of dying – Having many Contamina-
tion cards in an Action deck at the End of the Game makes it 
more likely for a Character to die.

For details see: Infection Procedure (page X) and Eclosion Procedure 
(page X).

In such a case the player can decipher the card using the Scanner. 

When Scanning a Contamination card you are looking for the word 
INFECTED:

•

•

If the card contains this exact word, it means the Contamina-
tion card is Infected.
If the card does not contain that word, the card is Not Infected.

The exact effect of Scanning Contamination cards is dependent on 
the Action used and should be described by the Action. Most com-
monly it is associated with the Infection Procedure.

For details see: Infection Procedure (page X).

infected by larva
Too  much  Contamination  may  result  in  a  Character  being  a  host 
for a Larva and, in effect, end with a Character’s death at the End 
of the Game.

The most common effect of being Infected is placing a Larva model 
on a Character board. Having a Larva on a Character board does not 
incur any penalties but heavily increases the chance of that Charac-
ter’s death during the End of the Game checks.

For details see: Eclosion Procedure (next page).

Larvae can be removed from Characters with a few in-game effects, 
such as the Surgery Room.

38

robot

Characters, while exploring the Fa-
cility,  may  come  upon  a  friendly 
Robot 
  in  the  Hibernatorium 
that  they  can  use  to  aid  them  in 
their  missions.  At  the  start  of 
the  game  it  is  not  known  which 
Robot  is  currently  used  in  the  Fa-
cility  –  it  is  chosen  randomly  at 
the  start.  The  Robot  also  does 
nothing on it’s own, they only perform Actions they’ve been assigned 
by Characters.

The Robot is completely ignored by Intruders in all cases – they 
are not interested in mechanical beings.

ACTIVATING THE ROBOT
There are 6 different Robot cards but only 1 can appear in a given 
game. Each card has a unique effect associated with the Robot.

Characters may use the “Activate the Robot” Action by discarding 
1 Action card:

•

Locally – if they are in a Room with the Robot

OR

• Remotely  –  if  they  are  in  a  Room  with  a  Computer 

and they discard 1 additional Action card.

DATA TOKEN
DATA TOKEN

A  Data  token  may  be  gained  by 
using the Server Room Action. 

Ch  aracters  with  this  token  may 
Activate  the  Robot  remotely  by 
discarding only 1 Action card.

MALFUNCTION MARKER ON THE ROBOT
The  Robot  can  sometimes  get  broken.  Various  game  effects  may 
place a Malfunction marker on the Robot.

A Robot with a Malfunction marker is considered to have no Action 
and all game effects mentioning the Robot (for example the Drilling 
Room) are unavailable. Tactical Gear tokens on the Robot can still 
be used, however.

If  a  Character  is  in  a  Room  with  the  Robot,  Actions  that  discard 
Malfunction markers may also do so from the Robot.

ROBOT MOVEMENT
The Robot never moves on it’s own. All of its movement is done as a 
result of player Actions. 

The Robot moves from a Room to a neighboring Room. It 
ignores Intruders (even the ones in Corridors) and 
 but 
it cannot move through Doors. It never makes a Noise roll.
The  Robot  can  never  move  through  an  Unexplored  Corridor  to  Ex-
plore a new Room.

ROBOT’S TACTICAL BELT
The  Robot  has  it’s  own  Tactical  Belt  and  starts  with  2  tokens  –  1 
Ammo token and 1 Oxygen token. When a player Uses their Tactical 
Gear tokens, while they are in the same Room as the Robot, they may 
also Use the Robot’s Tactical Gear tokens.

In that case the tokens can also be moved to the Character’s Tactical 
Gear slots.

DESTROYED FACILITY
When  the  Facility  is  destroyed,  the  game  ends  –  all  Charac-
ters in the Facility (even Hibernated) and Intruders (including 
the Queen) are considered killed. All Rooms (including the Nest) 
are considered Destroyed.

procedures

There are several Procedures that can be referenced by the game. 
Any  time  the  game  instructs  you  to  resolve  a  certain  Procedure, 
simply follow the steps below.
escape procedure
The Escape Procedure is used any time a Character performs a Hiberna-
torium, Landing Zone or Escape Shuttle Room Action.

When  an  Escape  Procedure  is  resolved  make  a  Noise  roll  using 
the standard rules and:

•

•

If an Intruder appears in the Room – the Action is unsuccess-
ful and ends immediately.
If  no  Intruder  appears  in  the  Room  –  you  successfully  per-
form the Action.

For details see: Noise roll (page X).
infection procedure
The Infection Procedure is used to check whether you are infected 
with Larva.

The Infection Procedure is always performed at the End of the Game 
(after  drawing  all  cards  to  the  player’s  hand),  but  may  also  some-
times be performed during the game (for example, by using the Rest
Action card).

To resolve the Infection Procedure:

1.
2.

Scan all Contamination cards in hand.
Look for the word INFECTED on the Scanned cards:

a.

b.

If  you  ﬁnd  the  word  Infected  on  a  card,  it  is  Infected  – 
place a Larva on your Character board, if you don’t have 
one already.
If you don’t ﬁnd such a word, the card is Uninfected.

3. Discard all Contaminations from your hand.

For details see: Contaminations (page X).

eclosion procedure
The  Eclosion  Procedure  is  a  moment  when  we  check  whether  a 
Character can survive being infected with a Larva.

The Eclosion Procedure is always performed at the End of the Game, 
but may also sometimes be performed during the game (for example, 
because of an Event effect).

To resolve the Eclosion Procedure:

1.
2.

Draw 4 cards from your Action deck.
If any of the cards at this point in your hand is a Contamina-
tion card your Character dies, regardless Infection status of 
the of the drawn Contamination cards.
– If this step was done during the game, place 1 Adult in 
the  Room  –  it  may  result  in  an  Intruder  Attack  against 
another Character.

3. Discard all cards from your hand.

autodestruction procedure 
autodestruction procedure 
The Facility is installed with an Autodestruction Procedure in case 
of emergency. It can be easily turned on in the Cooling System, but 
turning it off is not an easy task. It requires a complete power shut-
down in the Reactor Room.

When  an  Autodestruction  Procedure  is  Activated  for  the  ﬁrst  time, 
place the Autodestruction token 5 spaces ahead of the current round 
marker (there should be 4 empty spaces between the Round marker 
and the Autodestruction token). If there are not enough spaces on 
the  Round  track,  place  the  Autodestruction  token  behind  the  last 
space – the Autodestruction will activate upon the game end instead.

When a Round marker moves to the same space as the Autodestruc-
tion token, the Facility is destroyed and the game ends. 

The  Autodestruction  can  only  be  turned  off  by  using  the  Reactor 
Room.

lander
and anti-aircraft 
system

active

inactive

The Facility is equipped with Anti-Aircraft systems. As such, trying 
to Escape it using the Lander 

 may prove impossible.

At  the  start  of  the  game  Characters  do  not  know  if  the  system  is 
working or not, and it’s up to them to gather this information.

The  Anti-Aircraft  system  is  represented  by  2  Anti-Aircraft  tokens. 
During game setup, these tokens are placed face-down at the top of 
the Facility in a random order. The token on top indicates the status of 
the Anti-Aircraft system.

During  the  game  Characters  may  check  and  swap  those  tokens 
using the Life Support Control “B” Room.

RESOLVING ANTI-AIRCRAFT TOKENS
Anti-Aircraft  tokens  are  resolved  in  only  one  situation  –  when 
a  Round  marker  is  placed  on  the  space  with  the  Lander  token  – 
the  Lander  tries  to  land  in  the  Facility  but  may  be  destroyed  in 
the process. Check the top Anti-Aircraft token.

•
•

If it’s ACTIVE – the Lander is shot down. Discard the token.
If it’s INACTIVE – the Lander lands safely. Place the token on 
the Landing Zone Room. From now on Characters may use 
the Landing Zone Room to try and Escape.

For details see: Room List (page X).

When an Anti-Aircraft token is resolved, leave it revealed on top of 
the  other  Anti-Aircraft  token.  From  that  point  on,  the  Anti-Aircraft 
token cannot be changed again in any way.

lander
A Character can get into the Lander by using the Landing Zone Room 
Action, while the Lander token is already on the Landing Zone Room. 
The Character models in the Lander are placed on the Anti-Aircraft 
space. 

While a Character is in the Lander:

• Their Turns are skipped (but they do not Pass).
• They do not lose Oxygen, nor do they lose Health from any 
effects (such as Fire in the Room). They are effectively “out 
of the game”.
If any Intruder appears in the Landing Zone, they immediately 
leave the Lander and may act again during their next Turn. 

•

TAKING OFF USING THE LANDER
At the very start of the Event Phase any Character in the Lander may 
decide to Take Off. If that happens:

•
•

Remove the Lander token from game.
Place all Character models that were in that Lander, on their 
respective  Character  boards  –  they  have  safely  Escaped 
the Facility and no longer take part in the game.

Note: This is not a collaborative decision! It is enough for 1 Character 
to decide to Take Off.

ESCAPE SHUTTLE
Anti-Aircraft systems do not interact with the Escape Shuttle in any 
way.

end of the game

When  the  game  ends  there  are  still  a  few  checks  that  need  to  be 
done before players can determine winners.

At the end of the game perform the following sequence in order:

1.

2.

3.

Each Character without a Larva on their Character board
–  Draws  all  cards  from  the  deck  and  discard  pile  to  hand 
and performs the Infection Procedure. 
Each  Character  that  currently  has  a  Larva  on  their 
Character board – If a Character now has a Larva on their 
Character board they gain 1 Contamination card and shufﬂes 
their  hand  back  into  their  deck  and  performs  the  Eclosion 
Procedure.
For  details  see:  Infection  Procedure  (page  X)  and  Eclosion 
Procedure (page X).
Each  Character  who  is  still  alive  –  Reveals  and  checks 
their Objective.
–  If a Character has not chosen an Objective until that point, 
they simply do so now (before other players reveal their 
Objectives).

4.

Each  remaining  Character  who  succeeded  in  completing 
their Objective wins the game!

40

objective 
and mission task

Each Character has their own ambitions and desires, but the choices 
they  make  are  rarely  set  in  stone.  Objective  cards  are  goals  they 
choose during the game.

The Mission Task is a common mission for the squad. This card is 
revealed at the start of the game and can never change.

The Mission Task is available for players to be fulﬁlled, if their Mis-
sion Objective cards interact with it – some may require the player 
to fulﬁll the Task, but some may require the opposite. 

Objective  cards  are  dealt  individually  to  each  player.  There  are 
two  types  of  Objective  cards,  and  each  player  is  dealt  1  of  each 
at  the  start  of  the  game.  During  the  game  players  have  to  make 
a choice between one of their cards and fulﬁll all the requirements 
on that card to win the game. 

•

Private  Objectives  –  these  cards  are  all  unique  and  may 
feature a variety of conditions a Character should fulﬁll.
• Mission  Objectives  –  these  are  all  connected  to  the  Mis-
sion  Task  in  some  way.  Most  will  just  require  you  to  fulﬁll 
the Mission Task but in rare cases they may force you to play 
against other players.

additional modes
Deadly Mode

You may wish to increase the difﬁculty of the game. This mode is 
available both in the standard and in the Solo/Coop version of the 
game.

solo and coop rules

While  Nemesis  shines  as  a  semi-cooperative  experience,  you  can 
also play it in fully cooperative mode, or even solo. To facilitate that, 
special Solo-coop Objectives are used.

In Deadly mode some Corridors have 2 Noise values increasing the 
chances of Intruders appearing and entering Rooms.

When playing the Deadly mode use on Corridors both the standard 
Noise values and the second, smaller Noise values.

Corridors are treated as having both of those Noise values for any 
effects.

setup
Apply the following changes to the setup of the game:

1.

Instead  of  placing  a  random  Mission  Task  card,  draw  and 
place  1  Solo/coop  Mission  Task  for  each  Character  taking 
part in the game.

2. Do NOT draw standard Objective cards. They are not used 

For the sake of any Tie-breaks use only the standard Noise value.

in this mode.

winning
To win, all Mission Tasks must be fulﬁlled, and at least 1 Character 
must survive.

Note: If there are multiple Objectives requiring you to fulﬁll a require-
ment (such as gaining a Data token), that many Characters must do 
so and survive.

There  may  be  a  situation  in  which  the  Tasks  require  you  to  have 
more Data tokens than there are Characters in the game. In that case 
simply gain as many as it’s possible.

revive (coop only)
In this fully cooperative mode, the Surgery Room is equipped with 
a special AutoDoc device, allowing the marines to revive any near 
death person.

Whenever one of the Characters dies, leave their model on the board 
knocked  over.  When  Moving  from  a  Room  containing  the  model, 
another  Character  may  take  the  model  with  them  by  discarding  1 
additional Action card.

If a knocked over Character model starts a Round in a Surgery Room 
(there must be no Intruders and no Malfunction marker there), they 
are placed back up and discard all Serious Wounds.

Difficulty
We recommend starting with the standard setup, but it is possible to 
change the difﬁculty of the game for groups that are new or groups 
that are more experienced with Nemesis.

To do so, simply increase (or decrease) the number of Mission Tasks 
during setup.
